  Consider a curve is drawn in a counterclockwise fashion by
  \[
  \vec{c}(t) = \begin{pmatrix}
    2\cos(t)-\cos(2t)\\ 2\sin(t)-\sin(2t)
  \end{pmatrix}
  \]
  as $t$ runs from $0$ to $2\pi$. Let $R$ be the region enclosed by
  this curve. Set $\vec{H}(x,y) = \begin{pmatrix}-y/2\\ x/2\end{pmatrix}$ and use Green's
  theorem to compute the area of $R$.
