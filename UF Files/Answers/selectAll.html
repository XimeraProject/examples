<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a id="x1-1000"></a>How Select All works</h4>
<!--l. 14--><p class="noindent">Note that, basically everything about the select all environment is identical to the
multiple choice environment, except that multiple choices can be selected by
the student to account for needing multiple correct answers being selected
simultaneously.
<a id="Q1-1-3"></a>
</p>
<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a id="x1-2000"></a>How to generate Select All answers</h5>
<!--l. 18--><p class="noindent">The select all answer set is generated by an environment, cleverly named ’selectAll’
along with the choice command to enumerate choices. Indeed, the select all
environment is secretly a kind of retooled itemize/enumerate environment and
the choice command is secretly a retooled item command. So the following:
</p><pre>            \begin{selectAll}
 <br/>                \choice{First Choice is Wrong.}
 <br/>                \choice[correct]{Second Choice is Right.}
 <br/>                \choice{Third Choice is Wrong.}
 <br/>                \choice[correct]{Fourth Choice is Right!}
 <br/>                \choice{Fifth Choice is Wrong.}
 <br/>            \end{selectAll}
 <br/>        
<!--l. 27--></pre>Results in: <div class="select-all" id="problem1"><a id="x1-2001r1"></a> <span class="choice " id="choice1">First Choice is Wrong.</span> <span class="choice correct" id="choice2">Second Choice is Right.</span> <span class="choice " id="choice3">Third Choice is Wrong.</span>
<span class="choice correct" id="choice4">Fourth Choice is Right!</span> <span class="choice " id="choice5">Fifth Choice is Wrong.</span>
</div>
<!--l. 37--><p class="noindent">Notice that the correct answer has the optional argument [correct], more on that
below.
<a id="Q1-1-5"></a>
</p>
                                                                  

                                                                  
<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a id="x1-3000"></a>How select all validates an answer</h5>
<!--l. 42--><p class="noindent">Simply. Select all allows the student to click on as many answer choices as they want,
and then hit the “check work” button to check their answer. If they have selected
<em>exactly every</em> answer choice that is marked as correct (has the “[correct]” optional
argument), then they get credit for the problem, otherwise it is marked
wrong.
</p><!--l. 44--><p class="noindent">Notice this differs slightly from the multiple choice environment, in that it
requires the student to select every “correct” answer and none of the incorrect
answers before any credit is given, and doesn’t grey out answers (since it is not
clear from an unsuccessful attempt which selected answers were right or
wrong).
<a id="Q1-1-7"></a>
</p>
<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a id="x1-4000"></a>Optional Arguments</h4>
<!--l. 48--><p class="noindent">Select All itself (currently) has no optional arguments. The choice command
(currently) has only one key-value pair, which is the flag for whether the choice
is correct or not. Technically the key is ’correct’ and the value is ’true’ or
’false’, but the key defaults to ’false’ and simply using the key flips it to
true. In other words using <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb">\choice[correct]{Correct!}</span></span> is the same as
using <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb">\choice[correct=true]{Correct!}</span></span>, and both of those will mark
the given choice as the correct answer. Likewise <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb">\choice{False!}</span></span> and
<span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb">\choice[correct=false]{False!}</span></span> are equivalent, and both result in the answer
being incorrect.

<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a id="x1-5000"></a>Potential Pitfalls and Problems</h4>
<a id="Q1-1-11"></a>
<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a id="x1-6000"></a>Every correct answer must be selected</h5>
<!--l. 54--><p class="noindent">Since there is no clear feedback as to which answer is correct or incorrect when
students attempt a selection and check it, it can be frustrating for students that
think they have “tried every possible combination” and still haven’t gotten their
answer accepted. That being said, this is an inherent issue with this type of answer in
general, and not really a technological barrier/issue, it’s just something to keep in
mind.
<a id="Q1-1-13"></a>
</p>
<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a id="x1-7000"></a>There are a finite number of options/combinations</h5>
<!--l. 57--><p class="noindent">Since Xronos allows unlimited attempts at answering (this is a feature we intend to
make controllable in some way in the future, but currently all answers get
                                                                  

                                                                  
unlimited attempts), a clever-enough-to-be-dangerous student will realize
they can just spam the answer possibilities/combinations until they find the
right one and move on without even reading the options. With select all,
this obviously involves <em>significantly</em> more effort than with just a multiple
choice, but I have definitely had students <em>tell me</em> they have done this on a
bunch of these problems - so... chalk another one up to “if you had just
spent that effort figuring out the answer instead of ’cheating the system’ it
would have been less work.” There isn’t much to do about this, but it is
important to keep in mind when designing problems and deciding on answer-type
variety.
<a id="Q1-1-15"></a>
</p>
<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a id="x1-8000"></a>Randomization is ’kind of’ pointless</h5>
<!--l. 60--><p class="noindent">Although there are ways to randomize the content of the problems and answers (see
the randomization section), it is important to note that the LaTeX level content
<em>cannot</em> be randomized currently (this is going to be changed in the future
edition) which means, although the content of the choice command might be
randomized, <em>which</em> select all option(s) is/are correct <em>cannot</em> be randomized -
something that the students will pick up on mighty quick. For review this
isn’t <em>as bad</em> since students are at least aware enough that they are trying to
understand how the correct answer is the correct answer - so knowing “the
right answer are the first and third choices” is <em>less</em> important... but it’s still
important.
</p><!--l. 62--><p class="noindent">It is worth noting that there <em>is</em> a workaround for this that we have developed, which
is addressed in the randomization section, so if you want to make a randomized select
all problem, you should followup there.
