<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a id="x1-2000"></a>How to generate multiple choice answers</h5>
<!--l. 18--><p class="noindent">The multiple choice answer set is generated by an environment, cleverly named
’multipleChoice’ along with the choice command to enumerate choices. Indeed, the
multiple choice environment is secretly a kind of retooled itemize/enumerate
environment and the choice command is secretly a retooled item command. So the
following: </p><pre>            \begin{multipleChoice}
 <br/>                \choice{First Choice is Wrong.}
 <br/>                \choice{Second Choice is Wrong.}
 <br/>                \choice{Third Choice is Wrong.}
 <br/>                \choice[correct]{Fourth Choice is Right!}
 <br/>                \choice{Fifth Choice is Wrong.}
 <br/>            \end{multipleChoice}
 <br/>        
<!--l. 27--></pre>Results in:  <div class="multiple-choice" id="problem1"><span class="choice " id="choice1">First Choice is Wrong.</span> <span class="choice " id="choice2">Second Choice is Wrong.</span> <span class="choice " id="choice3">Third Choice is
Wrong.</span> <span class="choice correct" id="choice4">Fourth Choice is Right!</span> <span class="choice " id="choice5">Fifth Choice is Wrong.</span>  </div>
<!--l. 37--><p class="noindent">Notice that the correct answer has the optional argument [correct], more on that
below.
<a id="Q1-1-5"></a>
</p>
<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a id="x1-3000"></a>How multiple choice validates an answer</h5>
<!--l. 42--><p class="noindent">Simply. Multiple choice allows the student to click on (only) one answer choice, and
then hit the “check work” button to check their answer. If that answer is marked as
correct (has the “[correct]” optional argument), then they get credit for the problem,
otherwise it is marked wrong, which greys out the answer slightly and asks the
student to try again (thus the student can see which options they have already
tried).
                                                                  

                                                                  
</p><!--l. 44--><p class="noindent">Note that, this means if you have multiple choices flagged as correct, then if a
student selects <em>any</em> answer that is marked correct and checks it, they will get the
answer marked correct - which also locks the problem, so they won’t be able to check
other options for correctness.
<a id="Q1-1-7"></a>
</p>
<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a id="x1-4000"></a>Optional Arguments</h4>
<!--l. 50--><p class="noindent">Multiple Choice itself (currently) has no optional arguments. The choice command
(currently) has only one key-value pair, which is the flag for whether the choice is
correct or not. Technically the key is ’correct’ and the value is ’correct’ or
’incorrect’, but the key defaults to ’incorrect’ and simply using the key flips
it to correct. In other words using <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb">\choice[correct]{Correct!}</span></span> is the
same as using <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb">\choice[correct=true]{Correct!}</span></span>, and both of those will
mark the given choice as the correct answer. Likewise <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb">\choice{False!}</span></span> and
<span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb">\choice[correct=false]{False!}</span></span> are equivalent, and both result in the answer
being incorrect.

</p>
<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a id="x1-5000"></a>Potential Pitfalls and Problems</h4>
<a id="Q1-1-11"></a>
<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a id="x1-6000"></a>Only one answer can be selected</h5>
<!--l. 56--><p class="noindent">Since only one answer can be selected (selecting another one automatically deselects
any previous one) then having multiple ’correct’ answers in the list means a
student can only select one of them. Since Ximera locks the answer once it
is correct, the only way to test other answers for correctness is to “erase
work” and start over with a different selection. Since student’s won’t do this
in practice, and since they expect that only one answer being selectable
means there is only one correct answer - this can lead to the assumption
that since they got “the” correct answer, then all other answers <strong>must be</strong>
incorrect, which may result in questions as to why the other (actually correct)
answers aren’t correct - or even worse, the blanket assumption that they
must be incorrect without any questions or opportunities to correct that
misunderstanding.
<a id="Q1-1-13"></a>
</p>
<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a id="x1-7000"></a>There are a finite number of options</h5>
<!--l. 59--><p class="noindent">Since Ximera allows unlimited attempts at answering (this is a feature we intend to
make controllable in some way in the future, but currently all answers get
unlimited attempts), a clever-enough-to-be-dangerous student will realize
they can just spam the answer until they find the right one and move on
                                                                  

                                                                  
without even reading the options. There isn’t much to do about this, but it is
important to keep in mind when designing problems and deciding on answer-type
variety.
<a id="Q1-1-15"></a>
</p>
<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a id="x1-8000"></a>Randomization is ’kind of’ pointless</h5>
<!--l. 62--><p class="noindent">Although there are ways to randomize the content of the problems and answers
(see the randomization section), it is important to note that LaTeX level
content <em>cannot</em> be randomized currently (this is going to be changed in the
future edition) which means, although the content of the choice command
might be randomized, <em>which</em> multiple choice option is correct <em>cannot</em> be
randomized - something that the students will pick up on mighty quick. For
review this isn’t <em>as bad</em> since students are at least aware enough that they
are trying to understand how the correct answer is the correct answer - so
knowing “the right answer is the third choice” is <em>less</em> important... but it’s still
important.
</p><!--l. 64--><p class="noindent">It is worth noting that there <em>is</em> a workaround for this that we have developed, which
is <a href="https://xronos.clas.ufl.edu/examples/exampleCore/problemDesign/multipleChoice">addressed in the randomization section</a>, so if you want to make a randomized
multiple choice problem, you should followup there.
