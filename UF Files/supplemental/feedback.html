</p></div>   <div class="maketitle"></div>
<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a id="x1-1000"></a>How feedback works</h4>
<!--l. 13--><p class="noindent">There is a feedback environment to give feedback based on if the answer is correct, or
if the student just tried something.
<a id="Q1-1-2"></a>
</p>
<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a id="x1-2000"></a>How to generate/use the feedback environment.</h5>
<!--l. 17--><p class="noindent">Feedback can be provided to students using the feedback environment within a
problem-style environment. The feedback environment takes some optional
arguments (see below) to determine when it is displayed, but by default it is
displayed after any attempt at the problem (regardless of whether that attempt was
correct or incorrect).
</p><!--l. 19--><p class="noindent">For example, consider the following:
</p>
<div role="article" class="problem-environment problem" id="problem1"><a id="x1-2001r1"></a> Guess my number! <script type="math/tex">\answer {\pi }</script> <div class="feedback" data-feedback="attempt" id="feedback2">  <script type="math/tex">\pi </script>. The answer is <script type="math/tex">\pi </script>. </div>
</div>
<!--l. 28--><p class="noindent">The previous problem is generated by the code:
</p><!--l. 30--><pre>            \begin{problem}
 <br/>                Guess a number! $\answer{\pi}$
 <br/>                \begin{feedback}
 <br/>                    $\pi$. The answer is $\pi$.
 <br/>                \end{feedback}
 <br/>            \end{problem}
 <br/>        
<!--l. 37--></pre>
<!--l. 39--><p class="noindent">It is also worth noting that you can stack feedback environments in the same
question. For example, try the following:
</p>
                                                                  

                                                                  
<div role="article" class="problem-environment problem" id="problem3"><a id="x1-2002r2"></a>Ok, ok, that was unfair. Guess an integer this time. <script type="math/tex">\answer {31415}</script> <div class="feedback" data-feedback="attempt" id="feedback4"> The answer is 31415. Obviously.
</div>
<div class="feedback" data-feedback="correct" id="feedback5"> And this is only displayed because you’ve entered the correct answer. Good work! </div>
</div>
<a id="Q1-1-4"></a>
<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a id="x1-3000"></a>Optional Arguments</h4>
<!--l. 55--><p class="noindent">Currently feedback only has two optional arguments, which serve as triggers for when
the feedback is displayed:
     </p><dl class="description"><dt class="description">
correct </dt><dd class="description">The optional argument “correct” will ensure that the feedback is only
     displayed once the question has been flagged as “correct” and locked. This
     can be used for followup explanation of the problem once it has been
     correctly answered - in case you want to include information that would
     be too much information for a student still trying to answer it.
     </dd><dt class="description">
attempt </dt><dd class="description">The optional argument “attempt” will display the feedback after any
     attempt, regardless of whether that attempt is correct or incorrect. This
     is the default behavior of feedback if no optional argument is provided,
     and note that it is the only behavior that gives feedback when a student
     gives a wrong answer. However, it also doesn’t go away once the student
     gets the correct answer.</dd></dl>

<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a id="x1-4000"></a>Potential Pitfalls and Problems</h4>
<a id="Q1-1-8"></a>
<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a id="x1-5000"></a>Limited triggering</h5>
<!--l. 66--><p class="noindent">The feedback system only has the two current methods of triggering, either a correct
answer, or an attempt. There is a (very) limited custom validator written to give
targeted feedback based on specific numeric answers, but it uses javascript validation
methods, which are ... not awesome.
<a id="Q1-1-10"></a>
</p>
<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a id="x1-6000"></a>Content is only hidden, but it exists</h5>
<!--l. 69--><p class="noindent">Technically the content within a feedback environment exists, but is just hidden until
triggered. This means, if you want to do something like put another problem within
the feedback environment, and you customize the trigger so that a student completes
the page without triggering the feedback, then the problem they don’t see still counts
for “page credit” meaning that the student is now stuck without being able to get full
                                                                  

                                                                  
credit.
</p><!--l. 71--><p class="noindent">Under the current system, the only way a problem locks is if they get it
right, and correctly answered problems <em>always</em> display the feedback under
either of the default trigger behaviors - meaning that the above concern
isn’t possible under the existing system. But if you want to play with the
system and do custom work, be aware that this is an easy pitfall to land in by
accident.
