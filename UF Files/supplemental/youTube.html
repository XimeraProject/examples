<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a id="x1-1000"></a>How it works</h4>
<!--l. 13--><p class="noindent">YouTube content can be embedded (when embedding that video is allowed by the
video’s owner) easily in Xronos by using the <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb">\youtube</span></span> command. The command has
most of the embedding and url information already built in, so the only thing
you need to include is the part of the url that comes after the “v=” in the
url.
</p><!--l. 15--><p class="noindent">For example, in order to embed the video found at the url:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvgF95i0_lw" class="url">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvgF95i0_lw</a> you would use the command
<span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb">\youtube{FvgF95i0_lw}</span></span> which would embed the video into the page, like
this:
</p>
<div class="video youtube-player" data-youtube="FvgF95i0_lw">_</div>
<a id="Q1-1-3"></a>
<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a id="x1-2000"></a>How is it validated?</h4>
<!--l. 21--><p class="noindent">YouTube videos count toward the progress of a tile, but it only checks to see
what the saved progress of watching the video is. So if a student watches
the video all the way to the end, then they would get full credit for that
segment of their grade (see the previous tile on <a href="https://xronos.clas.ufl.edu/examples/exampleCore/assignments/creditAllocation">how credit broken up and
assigned/earned</a>).
<a id="Q1-1-5"></a>

<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a id="x1-3000"></a>Optional arguments</h4>
<!--l. 25--><p class="noindent">There are no optional arguments for the youtube command at this point.

<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a id="x1-4000"></a>Potential Pitfalls and Problems</h4>
<a id="Q1-1-9"></a>
<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a id="x1-5000"></a>Progress is tied to time stamp of last watched</h5>
<!--l. 29--><p class="noindent">It is noteworthy that the credit gained for a video is tied to the percentage last
completed of the video. This has two main points to consider.
                                                                  

                                                                  
     </p><dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
 (a) </dt><dd class="enumerate-enumitem">If the student skips to the end of the video, they can immediately get credit
     for watching the video, even though they didn’t watch it. This information
     is captured - so we plan on allowing or disallowing this ability in the future,
     and possibly having a notification for when students skip ahead for credit
     instead of watching video.
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
 (b) </dt><dd class="enumerate-enumitem">Sometimes YouTube will stop the video a second or two before the actual
     end  of  the  video.  We  implemented  a  “good  enough”  feature  to  video
     watching to account for this - basically if they watch more than 95% or
     so of the video it counts as full credit, but depending on the length of the
     video, this can sometimes still have a video registered as not completed by
     enough to mark the tile as not fully completed. This, in turn, can cause
     students to lose their minds as they try to assure their instructor that they
     watched everything fully and did everyone on the page, but can’t get full
     credit.
