<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a id="x1-1000"></a>The Problem, right-clicking</h4>
<!--l. 12--><p class="noindent">In order to make Xronos accessible (as in DRC accessibility) we use a well supported
and widely used library to render the mathematics in a way that is compatible with a
whole lot of different accessibility options. One of these features is the automatic
generating/providing of the LaTeX code that generates mathematics on the page
(interestingly, this is the primary way blind people do mathematics online, they learn
and use LaTeX syntax). So, if the original mathemode code is written in LaTeX, then
that code is exposed to the student (via a right-click menu in some cases)
as-is.
</p><!--l. 14--><p class="noindent">Unfortunately, this applies to <em>everything</em> in mathemode, which includes the <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb">\answer</span></span>
command (which must be in mathemode). Moreover, since the answer command has,
as it’s argument, the actual <em>answer</em> that Xronos is looking for, that means the
content of the answer command (a.k.a. the actual answer for the problem) is directly
available to students. By way of example:
</p>
<div role="article" class="problem-environment exercise" id="problem1"><a id="x1-1001r1"></a> Right click the following answer box and go to ‘show-math-as’ and then ‘TeX
Commands’ to figure out the desired answer! <script type="math/tex">\answer {4}</script>.
</div>
<!--l. 20--><p class="noindent">Obviously this isn’t ideal, as it allows students to just find and copy the answer code
into the answer box without doing the problem. There are reasons to actually want
this to be the case, <script type="text/javascript"> function footnotefunction(ID) { var x = document.getElementById(ID); if (x.style.display === "none") { x.style.color = "##002db3"; x.style.display = "inline"; } else { x.style.display = "none"; } } </script>   <span style="position=relative; vertical-align=baseline;"> <button onclick="footnotefunction(&#39;footnotei&#39;)" style="background:none!important; color:inherit; border:none; padding:0!important; font: inherit; cursor: pointer;"> <sup>[1]</sup> </button>   <span id="footnotei" style="display:none; font-family:Verdana, sans-serif; font-size:0.7em; line-height:1.1; display:inline; min-width:20em; position:absolute; left:25px; bottom:5px ; border:1px solid; padding:5px; color:##002db3; word-wrap:break-word; z-index=9999; overflow=auto;">  <span style="color:#4D00B2;">(It gives a known trap to funnel cheaters into and
detect them for example)</span></span></span>  but most instructors would prefer to disable this
feature.
</p><!--l. 24--><p class="noindent">Unfortunately we can’t <em>literally</em> disable it as a feature without killing all the
accessibility features of the page - which is obviously not something we want to do.
Fortunately however, there are ways to disable it in practice.

<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a id="x1-2000"></a>First Solution using just LaTeX</h4>
<!--l. 28--><p class="noindent">The key to understanding how to fix this, is to realize exactly what is being exposed
to the student. Specifically, the <em>content of the answer command</em> is what gets
displayed to the student. As a result, it is as simple as changing what is in the actual
                                                                  

                                                                  
answer command. The easiest way to manage this, is to declare a new command
that contains the answer and using that instead of the answer itself. For
example:
</p>
<div role="article" class="problem-environment problem" id="problem2"><a id="x1-2001r2"></a> Right-click the following answer box to find out the answer! <script type="math/tex">\answer {\ansOne }</script>
<!--l. 39--><p class="noindent">The code for the above problem is:
</p><!--l. 41--><pre>        \begin{problem}
 <br/>            Right-click the following answer box to find out the answer! $\answer{\ansOne}$
 <br/>            \begin{feedback}
 <br/>                Ha, got you! The answer is actually 6.
 <br/>            \end{feedback}
 <br/>        \end{problem}
 <br/>    
<!--l. 48--></pre>
<!--l. 50--><p class="noindent">However, the key that makes it work is the hidden previous line, which is
<span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb">\newcommand{\ansOne}{3!}</span></span>. Notice that I could actually leave the contents
unsimplified (indeed, it has 3! and Xronos still took 6 as the answer). This can be
used to obfuscate even more if you feel so inclined, but there isn’t really any reason
to do so.
</p><!--l. 52--><p class="noindent">Also note that you can (and should) define the answer command in the <em>body</em> of the
document (after the begin document command) since the preamble is largely
destroyed during the compiling of the assignment.
<a id="Q1-1-5"></a>
</p>
<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a id="x1-30002"></a>Potential Pitfalls and Problems</h5>
<!--l. 56--><p class="noindent">It is worth a note that you should have unique answer commands/macros for each
answer box to avoid unexpected behavior (technically it <em>should</em> expand answers as
they occur, but in practice you can run into some interesting expansion scope and
timing quirks of Xronos here, so it’s best to avoid it).
</p><!--l. 58--><p class="noindent">Also, ideally you want to avoid defining commands that depend on
other custom commands. For example you want to avoid something like:
<span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb">\newcommand{\ansTwo}{3 + \ansOne}</span></span>, writing instead <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb">\newcommand{\ansTwo}{3 + 3!}</span></span>.
Technically one can use custom commands within an answer command, but it almost
certainly needs to use an immediate expansion macro definition instead, which would
require the use of something like <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb">\edef</span></span> or <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb">\let</span></span> commands. If you don’t recognize the
difference between something like <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb">\edef</span></span> and <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb">\def</span></span> for LaTeX it is <em>highly</em>
recommended you just avoid using custom commands inside answer commands in
                                                                  

                                                                  
general.

<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a id="x1-40002"></a>Second Solution using Sage</h4>
<!--l. 63--><p class="noindent">Another option, which arguably has a number of other benefits, is to use sage to
generate the problem and the answer. For example, consider the following
problem:
</p>
<script type="text/sagemath">        p1c1 = 3
        p1f1 = 2*x + 4

        p1ans = p1f1(x=p1c1)
    </script></div>
<div role="article" class="problem-environment problem" id="problem3"><a id="x1-4001r3"></a> Let <script type="math/tex">f(x) = \sage {p1f1}</script>. Then <script type="math/tex">f(\sage {p1c1}) = \answer {\sage {p1ans}}</script>
<!--l. 79--><p class="noindent">The above code is generated by:
</p><!--l. 81--><pre>        \begin{sagesilent}
 <br/>            p1c1 = 3
 <br/>            p1f1 = 2*x + 4
 <br/>
 <br/>            p1ans = p1f1(x=p1c1)
 <br/>        \end{sagesilent}
 <br/>        \begin{problem}
 <br/>            Let $f(x) = \sage{p1f1}$. Then $f(\sage{p1c1}) = \answer{\sage{p1ans}}$
 <br/>
 <br/>            \begin{feedback}
 <br/>                Right click the answer box and see what it shows...
 <br/>            \end{feedback}
 <br/>        \end{problem}
 <br/>    
<!--l. 95--></pre>
<!--l. 97--><p class="noindent">The obvious upside here is that you can then use sage to generate randomized and
dynamic content in a nice way. If you are interested, you can check the advanced
features section for more information on using sage, and best-practices and associated
potential pitfalls and problems with sage.
