<!--l. 7--><p class="noindent">Alternative problem environments. These work identically in every way, but
have different ’titles’ and can be used to signal to students different types of
problems.

<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a id="x1-1000"></a>How they work</h4>
<!--l. 14--><p class="noindent">There are a number of alternative variants of the problem environment. The key
thing to know is that they are <em>literally</em> the same as the problem environment in every
meaningful way (they use the same commands and formatting macros under the
hood as the problem environment), the only way they differ is the displayed name.
Currently there are the following problem-style environments:
</p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">problem
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">question
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">exercise
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">exploration</li></ul>
<!--l. 23--><p class="noindent">There are ways to create new forms of these problem-style environments with
different names, although it requires some minor alterations of the ximera.4ht file, so
if you want to do this you would need to contact the Ximera admin on further steps
to take.

</p>
<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a id="x1-2000"></a>Numbering</h4>
<!--l. 27--><p class="noindent">Notice the numbering of the following problem-style environments: </p><div role="article" class="problem-environment problem" id="problem1"><a id="x1-2001r1"></a> This is a
problem, and the answer is 1! <script type="math/tex">\answer {1}</script>
</div>
<div role="article" class="problem-environment question" id="problem2"><a id="x1-2002r2"></a> This is a problem, and the answer is 2! <script type="math/tex">\answer {2}</script>
</div>
<div role="article" class="problem-environment exercise" id="problem3"><a id="x1-2003r3"></a> This is a problem, and the answer is 3! <script type="math/tex">\answer {6}</script>
</div>
                                                                  

                                                                  
<div role="article" class="problem-environment exploration" id="problem4"><a id="x1-2004r4"></a> This is a problem, and the answer is 4! <script type="math/tex">\answer {24}</script>
</div>
<!--l. 45--><p class="noindent">The problem-style environments share a counter by default in order to minimize
student confusion when they ask about “problem 7”, to avoid the situation where
they really meant the seventh problem on the page, and not actually “problem 7”, as
this case there is only one problem-style environment with that number, making it
easy to determine which problem the student is (theoretically at least) referring
to.
<a id="Q1-1-5"></a>
</p>
<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a id="x1-3000"></a>So why have different ones?</h4>
<!--l. 49--><p class="noindent">Typically authors use the different types of problem environments to represent
different styles of problems. For example, one might make any problem with
sub-questions an “exploration” problem to tip students off that there are
subproblems involved even before they see them. Likewise, a “problem” might be a
difficult problem, an “exercise” might be a mechanical-only skillset problem,
and an “exercise” might be an easier level problem. Again this is up to the
content author, the option is there if you are interested, but it need not be
used.
