<h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-1000"></a>Methods of Randomization</h3>
<!--l. 12--><p class="noindent">There are two main routes one could take to implement randomization, LaTeX and
Sage.
<a id="Q1-1-3"></a>
</p>
<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a id="x1-2000"></a>LaTeX randomization - works in theory, but not in practice.</h4>
<!--l. 15--><p class="noindent">LaTeX is a Turing-Complete language, which means it certainly can provide
randomization. Indeed, I have actually <a href="https://github.com/xronosuf/Xronos-Latex-Package/blob/master/OptionalPackages/randomize.sty">written some useful randomization packages</a>
for LaTeX myself.
</p><!--l. 17--><p class="noindent">Unfortunately, although one could implement this randomization into the LaTeX
code for Xronos, the problem comes in how Xronos is currently published <script type="text/javascript"> function footnotefunction(ID) { var x = document.getElementById(ID); if (x.style.display === "none") { x.style.color = "##002db3"; x.style.display = "inline"; } else { x.style.display = "none"; } } </script>   <span style="position=relative; vertical-align=baseline;"> <button onclick="footnotefunction(&#39;footnotei&#39;)" style="background:none!important; color:inherit; border:none; padding:0!important; font: inherit; cursor: pointer;"> <sup>[1]</sup> </button>   <span id="footnotei" style="display:none; font-family:Verdana, sans-serif; font-size:0.7em; line-height:1.1; display:inline; min-width:20em; position:absolute; left:25px; bottom:5px ; border:1px solid; padding:5px; color:##002db3; word-wrap:break-word; z-index=9999; overflow=auto;">  <span style="color:#4D00B2;">(As an
important note, this will change in the next version of Xronos - which will compile
LaTeX directly in the browser, which opens up all kinds of interesting possibilities.)</span></span></span>
.
</p><!--l. 20--><p class="noindent">Currently, Xronos is published using the Xake tool, which essentially translates the
TeX files into html and javascript (among other things), and then pushes
those files to the server. But this means that all the LaTeX content is run
and translated into the webpage <em>when the page is published</em>. In other words,
the only time LaTeX is run (and thus the only time any randomization at
the LaTeX level that occurs) happens when an update is published to the
web.
</p><!--l. 22--><p class="noindent">So, in order to get any kind of LaTeX-level randomization, you’d need to republish
the assignment each time you wanted to randomize it. Moreover, this would only
randomize the content served to the server, not to the students - in other words,
every student would necessarily get the <em>same</em> randomized content, it wouldn’t be
different for each student in any way.
<a id="Q1-1-5"></a>
</p>
<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a id="x1-3000"></a>Sage randomization</h4>
<!--l. 25--><p class="noindent">The other option is to use the sagetex package for LaTeX and sage code to
implement randomization. This has the benefit of having a much more powerful
programming syntax and tools to enable much more complex mathematical
                                                                  

                                                                  
manipulation. In order to use sage however, you would likely want to get a local
installation of sage and sagetex in order to be able to debug content locally
before publishing it to the web. You can read more about getting <a href="https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/misc/sagetex.html">a local
installation of sage and sagetex here</a> - the details are beyond the scope of this
document.
</p><!--l. 27--><p class="noindent">In the case of sage, the seed for all randomization is set behind the scenes at the
server level. This is important for three reasons.
     </p><dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
 (a) </dt><dd class="enumerate-enumitem">The randomization needs to be stable so that each time a given student
     loads  a  page,  they  get  the  same  problem  -  rather  than  getting  new
     problems every time they see the page (this would be especially confusing
     when  looking  back  at  problems  they  got  “right”,  since  the  displayed
     question and the provided answer wouldn’t match up once the displayed
     problem randomized to something new).
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
 (b) </dt><dd class="enumerate-enumitem">A design decision was made to allow students to get the same problems
     in the same order for a given randomization for a given semester. This
     allows them to work together on problems, since they would all get the
     same variation of a problem together, then they could all hit “try another”
     and end up with the same problem on the next iteration as well.
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
 (c) </dt><dd class="enumerate-enumitem">Instructors can load a page and see the same problems in the same order,
     that students got, since they are also loading the same content with the
     same randomization seed.</dd></dl>
